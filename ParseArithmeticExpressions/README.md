This program evaluates a arithmetic expression in Java using Stacks .

The program follows two steps :
1) Convert a string in Infix notation to Postfix notation 
2) Evaluate this postfix notation 


Why convert at all ?
It turns out that the postfix notation is easier for an algorithm to evaluate . Stacks is the ideal data structure for this case .
